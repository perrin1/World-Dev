# WorldDev
 Next js Side Project

## for this mini project it is necessary
- install dependencies <br>
- redo the configuration of the .env to add the environment variables, <br>
## for what is missing I had to omit 
- the fetch data at the initial,<br>
- the show data,<br>
- and I did not do the serche data<br>
- I also had to remove the payment :)<br>

### I'll let you take the prototype to do what you want with it
